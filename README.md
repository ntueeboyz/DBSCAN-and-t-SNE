# DBSCAN-and-t-SNE
In here, I used the MNIST data to demostrate tSNE and DBSCAN algorithms.

## [`main.py`](./main.py)
The main function imports the MNIST csv file and reduces the high dimensionality to 2-D.
Then plots the t-SNE figure with labels and the t-SNE figure with DBSCAN clustering.

## [`DR_plot.py`](./DR_plot.py)
The file includes two functions, DR_Plot and DR_Plot_black. 

DR_plot:
Input sample labels, n x 2 embedded array, and the "filename" you want to save.
The output would be the scatter figure with color label depending on samples.

DR_plot_black:
Input sample n x 2 embedded array, and the "filename" you want to save.
The output would be the scatter figure.

## [`readMNIST.py`](./readMNIST.py)
To import the MNIST csv file and output with the data matrix and sample labels.

## Result
